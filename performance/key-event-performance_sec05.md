# 5. Decision Matrix: Architecture by Scenario

Chapters 1–4 established the semantics, the machine, the measurements, and the budget; this chapter converts them into orders. Every prescription is justified in one breath: a measured anchor from this investigation's Chromium 150 sandbox, plus the engine reason that makes the number portable. One framing rule governs all of it: engine costs are ns–µs against a 15–60 ms hardware floor [^8^] and a ~26 ms I/O floor [^10^], so the matrix optimizes *library cleanliness and worst-case throughput* — deep DOMs, high churn, thousands of matches per interaction — while what actually hits INP's 200 ms p75 threshold [^20^] is your handler body. Choose architecture by scenario; spend optimization effort inside the handler.

## 5.1 By application type

### 5.1.1 Key identification: `code` for physical, `key` for semantic, `keyCode` only for legacy tables

Pick the property by *meaning*, never by speed — every accessor, legacy or modern, lands within 1–6% of the no-read baseline in the sandbox, with `e.which` literally tying it. There is no performance argument among them.

- **Games and positional layouts (WASD): use `event.code`.** `"KeyA"` is the physical position — the key "labelled `q` on an AZERTY keyboard" [^18^] — so bindings survive layout switching for free. `code` also pre-encodes `location` (`"ShiftLeft"` vs `"ShiftRight"`).
- **Shortcut managers and text UIs: use `event.key` plus the four modifier booleans.** `key` is the layout-resolved meaning — `"q"`/`"Q"`, `"Enter"` [^17^] — which is what "Ctrl+Q" means to a user. Add `getModifierState("Accel")` when you need the platform-correct command modifier [^24^].
- **`keyCode`/`which`/`charCode`: only as lookup keys into pre-existing legacy tables.** They are deprecated, "system and implementation dependent… inconsistent across platforms" [^19^], and report 0 on synthetic events — but the number compare is fast and old tables are keyed on them. The one modern use is defensive: `keyCode === 229` as the IME "not yours" marker [^20^].
- **Hoist `e.key` into a local once per handler regardless.** Blink and WebKit cache the string eagerly at construction [^4^][^13^]; Gecko re-maps it through key-name tables *on every access* [^23^]. Free in two engines, a real win in the third — a zero-cost portability move.

### 5.1.2 Listener topology: one root listener + internal dispatch; capture poisons SkipEventCapture

For any library, the default is **one listener at `document` plus an internal dispatch table**. Position is settled: leaf-vs-root measures 1.002 at depth 1 and 1.006 at depth 500 — statistically irrelevant, because Blink builds the O(D) EventPath once and walks it regardless [^6^][^7^]. What matters is *boundary crossings*: N listeners are N full C++→JS invocations with no batching possible (§2.4), so one fat listener switching on `e.code` in JS amortizes what many small native registrations cannot.

On phase: **register in the bubble phase unless you have a correctness reason not to.** Capture and bubble measure within 1.01 of each other — phase is free per dispatch — but any capture listener anywhere flips Blink's document-global `HasCaptureListener()` predicate and disables the default-on SkipEventCapture optimization *for every dispatch on the page* [^6^][^19^]; WebKit's per-document `EventListenerCounts` behaves identically [^13^]. A shortcut library registering `addEventListener('keydown', fn, true)` "to run first" taxes every listener-free dispatch of every type for the whole page. If you genuinely need first-mover semantics, scope the capture listener to the smallest subtree, not `window`.

Depth rarely matters because you rarely control it — but know the cliff: dispatch rises from ~4.0 µs at depth 1 to ~32 µs at depth 500 (~8×). Since path cost is paid whether or not listeners exist, the mitigation is handler-side: `stopPropagation()` on a consumed shortcut measured **17% faster** than letting it propagate. Stacking is free, spreading is not: 1/10/100 listeners on one node sit within 2.2% of each other; 10 listeners across 10 ancestors run 2.74× slower. Dispatch is path-bound, not invocation-bound.

## 5.2 By event volume and registration churn

### 5.2.1 High-churn UIs: delegation always; static apps: direct listeners fine

Delegation's dispatch-time cost is a wash — one document listener doing `e.target.closest('[data-k]')` fires at 176k ops/s against 174k for 1000 direct listeners (1.2%, inside CV). The decision is made at *registration*: one add/remove pair costs ~0.75 µs (0.744 µs precisely); 1000 direct registrations cost 766.9 µs — on the order of 1000× the delegated single registration, perfectly linear, no batching discount in Blink's listener list management. So:

- **High-churn UIs** (virtualized lists, mount/unmount cycles, per-render re-registration): delegate, unconditionally. Delegated registration is O(1) in control count; direct is O(N) at ~0.77 µs per control, paid again on every teardown.
- **Static apps** with a bounded handful of controls: direct listeners are fine — registration is paid once, dispatch is at parity either way.
- The delegated selection predicate is a correctness choice, not a speed one: `closest`, `matches`, `tagName`, and `composedPath()[0]` all measured within 4.2%. Use `closest` for clarity; avoid `composedPath()` in loops only because it allocates a fresh array per call [^11^].

### 5.2.2 Teardown: `removeEventListener` for hot paths; `AbortSignal` for ergonomic bulk teardown

Removing 100 listeners explicitly costs 44.2 µs per full cycle; the AbortController route — 100 signal-bound registrations plus one `abort()` — costs 83.8 µs, **1.9× slower end-to-end**, because signal bookkeeping at registration outweighs single-call removal, and `abort()` still runs K individual removal algorithms with no batch fast path (§2.4). Verdict: `AbortSignal` is an ergonomics and leak-safety feature — one `abort()` retires an entire modal scope without storing callback references [^2^] — not a speed feature. Use it for scope teardown at human timescales (dialog close, route change); use explicit `removeEventListener` where teardown itself is hot. `once: true` sits between them: the full register+dispatch+auto-remove cycle runs only ~34% above the plain dispatch baseline — fine for fire-once shortcuts. Whichever you choose, keep stable function references: anonymous callbacks defeat both dedup and removal, since matching keys on (type, callback, capture) only [^7^].

## 5.3 The master decision table

Scenario → listener topology → key-identification strategy → matching structure → measured anchor → engine reason. All measurements from this investigation's Chromium 150 sandbox; spec-level claims cited to source. For the library-source-level internals behind rows 1–3 — how shipping shortcut engines implement the trie, the chord state machine, the scope stack — see Chapter 6.

| # | Scenario | Listener topology | Key ID strategy | Matching structure | Measured anchor | Engine reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Global shortcut library | One `document` bubble listener + internal dispatch | `e.key` + modifier booleans | Bitmask int → `Map<number>` | 16.5M ops/s vs 5.4M string (3.1×) | N listeners = N C++→JS crossings; string concat, not the hash, is the cost |
| 2 | Multi-stroke chords | Same root listener, JS state machine | `e.code` for position, `e.key` for mnemonics | Map-of-Maps trie | 14.6M ops/s (0.88 of bitmask; tail-latency caveat) | Same amortization; trie depth costs one Map.get per stroke |
| 3 | Command palette / per-keystroke filtering | Root listener + `input` observer | `e.key` | Bitmask + Map, precomputed | Scan of 50 bindings: 2.3M ops/s, 7.2× slower | Thousands of matches per interaction is the only regime where matching shows |
| 4 | Text editor / contenteditable | Direct listener on editable root; `document` fallback | `e.key`; guard `isComposing` / `keyCode===229` | Early-exit guards, then Map | Guards <0.5% (under noise floor) | Keyboard default actions run synchronously after dispatch — a slow handler delays insertion directly |
| 5 | Game loop (WASD, held keys) | `window` keydown+keyup pair, bubble; key-state Set | `e.code` (layout-independent [^18^]) | `Map<code→action>` or bitmask; first-line `e.repeat` guard | Property reads within 1–6%; repeat guard <0.5% | Each auto-repeat tick is one full pipeline traversal — 30 dispatches/s, no engine throttling |
| 6 | Form UI / dialogs / focus traps | Delegated `document` listener; cancel `keydown` for Tab containment [^30^] | `e.key` (`"Tab"`, `"Escape"`, `"Enter"`) | `closest()` scope check + Map | Delegation dispatch parity (176k vs 174k) | Shortcut scope is focus scope; `keydown` cancellation blocks focus movement [^15^] |
| 7 | Global hotkeys ("run first") | Smallest-subtree listener, bubble; capture only with justification | `e.key` + `getModifierState("Accel")` [^24^] | Bitmask + Map | capture≈bubble 1.01 at depth 500 | Any capture listener disables SkipEventCapture page-wide [^6^][^19^] |
| 8 | High-churn UI (mount/unmount per render) | Delegation, always | Either | Either | Registration 0.74 µs/pair → 1000× for 1000 listeners | No batching discount; direct is O(N) at setup *and* teardown |
| 9 | Static app, few controls | Direct listeners on the controls | Either | Either | 1/10/100 same-node listeners within 2.2% | Path computed once; per-node invocation cheap; registration paid once |
| 10 | Deep DOM (>100 depth) | Single root listener (position irrelevant) | Either | Either | 4.0 µs @depth1 → 32 µs @depth500 (~8×) | O(D) EventPath built per dispatch, never cached; paid even with zero listeners |
| 11 | Anti-pattern: handlers spread up the tree | Consolidate onto one node | — | — | 10 listeners / 10 ancestors: 3× slower | Each ancestor with listeners pays snapshot clone + boundary crossing |
| 12 | Modal/route scope teardown | Any + `AbortController({signal})` | — | — | `abort()` route 1.9× slower than explicit removal for 100 | Per-listener abort algorithms, no batch fast path — pay for ergonomics knowingly |
| 13 | Teardown on a hot path | Explicit `removeEventListener`, stable references | — | — | 44 µs vs 84 µs per 100-listener cycle | Plain map scan + vector erase; matching keys on (type, callback, capture) only [^7^] |
| 14 | Fire-once shortcut | Any + `once: true` | Either | Either | 183k ops/s full cycle, +34% over baseline | Auto-removal at invoke time is modest bookkeeping [^2^] |
| 15 | Consuming a handled shortcut | Any — call `stopPropagation()` + `preventDefault()` | — | — | stopPropagation 17% faster than propagating; preventDefault within noise | Skips remaining path walk; cancel bit suppresses `beforeinput`/`input` (200→0 trusted events) [^15^] |
| 16 | IME-heavy input (CJK) | Any; guards non-negotiable | Skip while `e.isComposing`; treat 229 as "not yours" [^20^] | Guard first, match second | Guards <0.5% | `keydown` fires throughout composition with `isComposing: true` [^15^]; divergence is per-browser |
| 17 | Synthetic event bus / test tooling | Any — reuse one preconstructed event | Constructor sets `key`/`code`; `keyCode` stays 0 [^27^] | Either | Reuse: 776k vs 246k ops/s — 3.2× | Construction is over half of construct+dispatch; only synthetic flows may pool events |
| 18 | Legacy keymap integration | Any | `keyCode`/`which` as legacy table keys only | Number-keyed Map | `e.which` ties no-read baseline (1.000) | Deprecated and platform-inconsistent [^19^] — but the number read itself is free |

Two patterns deserve code, because they are the ones libraries get wrong. The canonical hot handler — guard, hoist, mask, map:

```js
const bindings = new Map(); // bitmask int -> command
function mask(e) { // 4 modifier bits + key index: one integer, no strings
  return (e.shiftKey | e.ctrlKey << 1 | e.altKey << 2 | e.metaKey << 3) << 8 | keyIndex(e);
}
addEventListener('keydown', e => {           // bubble: keep SkipEventCapture alive
  if (e.repeat || e.isComposing || e.keyCode === 229) return; // free guards
  const cmd = bindings.get(mask(e));          // 16.5M ops/s vs 5.4M for string keys
  if (!cmd) return;
  e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();    // consumption is an optimization, not overhead
  cmd(e);
});
```

And the honest teardown split — ergonomics at scope boundaries, explicit removal where teardown is hot:

```js
// Scope teardown (dialog close): pay the 1.9x for leak-safety.
const scope = new AbortController();
el.addEventListener('keydown', onKey, { signal: scope.signal });
closeButton.onclick = () => scope.abort();   // retires every listener in the scope

// Hot-path churn (per-render): explicit removal wins 44 µs vs 84 µs per 100.
function unmount() { el.removeEventListener('keydown', onKey); } // stable reference required
```

Everything the matrix omits is deliberate. `passive` on `keydown` is a performance no-op — keyboard was never in the intervention's scope [^19^]. `on*` property handlers and `{handleEvent}` objects cost 8–10% over a plain function — acceptable for stateful or legacy-interop listeners, wrong for the hot global keymap. And no row moves the INP needle by itself: dispatch at realistic depth is ~10⁻⁴ of a 30 ms keyboard trip. The matrix buys a clean, worst-case-safe architecture in microseconds; the remaining milliseconds — handler-body duration, long tasks, scheduling with `scheduler.yield()` [^28^] — are yours to spend or save.
