## 5. Decision Matrix: Which API for Which Situation

Chapters 1–4 established the semantics, the engine mechanics, the measured ratios, and the historical drift. This chapter converts that evidence into orders. Every directive below answers three questions in sequence: **what do you know about the target** (identity, structure, or only a predicate), **how do you access the result** (once, repeatedly, or iteratively), and **what is the document regime** (size, mutation rate). Answer them honestly and §5.4 hands you the API.

One global law precedes everything else: any API whose throughput degrades with node count is borrowing against document growth. In this investigation's sandbox (Chrome 150), the map-backed group held flat at 0.99–1.06× across a 77× fixture growth while `querySelectorAll('span')` collapsed 83×. When in doubt, choose the API whose cost curve you cannot make worse by adding markup.

### 5.1 By target knowledge: you know the ID / class / tag / structure / nothing

#### 5.1.1 Known ID → getElementById (document or shadow root); known class/tag at scale → getElementsBy*

**Known ID: use `getElementById`.** Measured in this investigation's sandbox (Chrome 150), it beats `querySelector('#id')` by 1.18× at 20K nodes, both O(1) flat from 261 to 20,097 nodes. The gap is narrow — far narrower than the 4–9× of the 2021–2026 published record[^11^][^2^] — because both resolve through the same per-tree id map; the residual is selector parse and dispatch overhead, not lookup cost. The decisive reasons are therefore not the 1.18× but the ergonomics of the fast path: no parse, no `SyntaxError`, no `CSS.escape()`, and it exists on `ShadowRoot`, since `getElementById` lives on the `DocumentOrShadowRoot` mixin and ids are unique per tree.[^21^] Inside a shadow root, `shadowRoot.getElementById(...)` is the only indexed option; no document-level call reaches in.[^21^] Never take the legacy shortcuts: `window['id']` measured 2.8× slower and `document.forms['name']` 8.8× slower, both routing through named getters instead of the id map — and both are spec-fragile besides.

**Known class or tag at scale: use `getElementsByClassName` / `getElementsByTagName`.** gEBCN held 9.3M ops/s at 20K nodes while `querySelectorAll('.c-target')` fell to 163.9K — 57× slower; gEBTN held ~11M ops/s while `querySelectorAll('span')` collapsed 38×/273×/3292× by size, the widest gap measured. The reason is the scan-vs-map dichotomy: Blink serves these from tree-indexed class/tag caches with invalidation-based liveness,[^4^][^5^] while qSA must walk every candidate and build a static list. The measured 57× exceeds the post-2022 published ~4.5×[^14^] only because the published fixtures are small — same curve, different DOM size. A tag-name hot path routed through qSA is a bug at any size.

#### 5.1.2 Known structure → direct property walk (firstElementChild/nextElementSibling) beats any query

**If you know where the node is, walk there; do not query.** `firstElementChild` measured 2.1× over `children[0]` (which constructs a full HTMLCollection to read one entry) and 3.7× over `childNodes[0]` — and `childNodes[0]` is additionally a semantic trap, returning the text node. A `nextElementSibling` chain beat a `nextSibling`-with-nodeType-skip loop by 2.3× and both TreeWalker and NodeIterator by ~2.2×, whose iterator allocation dominates at this range. Element-only accessors keep the filtering in C++; every JS-visible alternative pays a per-step binding crossing or an allocation. For ancestor search, `closest()` beat the hand-rolled `parentNode` loop by 4.1× (`classList.contains` guard) and 3.7× (`matches()` guard) on a 500-deep chain — the engine walks the same 50 ancestors with no JS↔C++ crossing per step, and selector complexity inside `closest()` was nearly free (0.99× for a compound vs plain class). Delete manual ancestor loops. In delegation guards, the order is `tagName ===` > `classList.contains` (0.63×) > `matches()` (0.44×): cached-string identity, then token-set lookup, then selector parse — though all three exceed 10M ops/s, so this matters only in genuinely hot dispatch.

#### 5.1.3 Complex relational criteria → querySelector with simple key compound; attribute presence → qSA('[attr]') never '*'+filter

**When all you have is a predicate, querySelector(All) is the right tool — but write the selector for the matcher.** Engines match right-to-left: the rightmost compound filters every candidate, and everything left of the rightmost combinator is per-survivor verification, not candidate reduction.[^24^] The sandbox selector ladder prices this: at 20K nodes the full spread from `span` (3.6K ops/s) down to `:nth-child(3)` (1.0K) is only 3.5× — constant factors, never the orders of magnitude of §5.1.1. So: put the most selective, indexable term in the key position, avoid structural pseudo-classes (sibling-position bookkeeping per candidate), and expect tuning to win you 2–3× at most. Selector simplification never fixes an algorithmically wrong API choice.

**`#a .b` is never faster than `.b`.** Both face the identical candidate set; the id prefix only adds an ancestor walk per `.b` survivor.[^24^] The correct way to shrink candidates is to shrink the root: `getElementById('a').querySelectorAll('.b')` — with the §5.3.2 caveat that scoping is a cache-miss optimization, not a universal one. And prefix `:scope` on element-rooted queries, which match against the whole tree before filtering to descendants.[^10^]

**Attribute presence or equality: use `qSA('[data-x="1"]')`, never `getElementsByTagName('*')` plus a manual filter.** The measured margin is 19× at medium and 12× at large. Both are O(n) scans, but the manual variant materializes a live collection of every element and crosses the JS↔C++ boundary for each `getAttribute`, while qSA evaluates the predicate inside the engine. The old "grab everything and filter in JS" advice is refuted, not merely outdated.

**Never XPath.** `document.evaluate('//*[@data-x="1"]')` measured 26× slower than the equivalent qSA and ~70,000× slower than gEBCN on an equivalent class at 20K nodes — an interpreted expression engine with its own snapshot object and zero index acceleration. If the markup is yours, mirror the attribute with a class: that single change is worth four to five orders of magnitude, the largest lever in this book.

### 5.2 By access pattern: one-shot vs repeated vs iteration

#### 5.2.1 One-shot single hit → qS over qSA[0]; repeated → cache reference or live collection (6.1×/13,700×)

**One shot, one hit: use `querySelector`, never `querySelectorAll(...)[0]`.** qS bails at the first match (`kShouldOnlyMatchFirstElement`); qSA walks the whole subtree and allocates the full static list to hand you one entry.[^1^] The same laziness argument makes `gEBCN('x')[0]` acceptable for a single class hit: creation is ~O(1) registration, cost deferred to access.[^30^]

**Repeated access: cache, and cache the right thing.** The ×100 re-query benchmark is unambiguous: holding one cached live collection beat 100 fresh gEBCN calls by 6.1× and 100 fresh qSA calls by ~13,700× at the large fixture. Construction — not liveness maintenance — is the expense; liveness only charges when the DOM mutates, and read-only loops never pay it. Best of all is a cached element reference in JS: a field load on your own object is ~1–2 machine instructions via hidden-class inline caches, while a DOM method call can never be inlined across the binding boundary.[^16^][^17^] Re-querying an identical selector string also leans on engine parse caches (Blink: 256 entries per document; WebKit: 512 global),[^1^][^6^] so dynamically generated selector strings thrash them — validate and hoist selector strings out of hot paths.[^3^]

#### 5.2.2 Iterate-then-mutate → snapshot live collection first; read-only hot loops → cached-length live loop

**Iterating while mutating: snapshot first.** Removing `live[i]` shifts every later element down one index and silently skips successors; growing while testing `i < live.length` never terminates.[^30^] Take a static snapshot — `Array.from(live)` or a qSA static NodeList — then mutate freely. Iterating a mutating tree with a cursor: `NodeIterator`, whose reference node is adjusted by pre-remove steps, not `TreeWalker`, whose cursor strands on a detached node.[^12^][^11^]

**Read-only hot iteration: classic `for` loop over the live collection, length hoisted.** Measured: cached-length live loop 1.00; re-reading `.length` per iteration 1.23× slower (each access re-validates the cached snapshot — a C++ round trip per element); iterating a freshly built static NodeList 1.37× slower (list construction amortized over one pass); `NodeList.forEach` 2.4× slower (callback overhead at ~2K–20K elements). Cache the collection *and* its length; keep `forEach` off hot paths.

### 5.3 By DOM size and mutation rate

#### 5.3.1 Small DOM (<1K nodes): everything fast enough except XPath; large DOM: only map-backed APIs stay flat

Below ~1K nodes, constant factors dominate and nearly every API is fast enough — the 38× small-fixture gEBTN margin is real but lands on microsecond absolute times. XPath is the sole exception: catastrophic at every size. As the document grows, the scaling law takes over: id/class/tag map-backed lookups stay flat (0.99–1.06× across 77× growth); every scan-backed call degrades ~linearly (qSA('span') 83×). At large sizes there is no selector cleverness that rescues a scan — only an index keeps you flat.

#### 5.3.2 High mutation rate: live collections thrash invalidation — prefer static qSA or cached arrays

Live collections win under read-heavy, repeat access (§5.2.1) and lose under churn: every relevant mutation walks ancestors invalidating node-list caches,[^5^] and mutating `class` while iterating a class-based list invalidates the list under your feet. In mutation-dense code, pay the walk once: take a static qSA snapshot or `Array.from` a live collection into a cached array, then iterate plain memory. One scoping caveat from the sandbox must travel with this advice: document-level `querySelector` measured **1.28× faster** than the same query rooted at a near-top subtree, because the document-level class cache hit decisively on a rare class — fixture-dependent, and reversible for common classes or small deep scopes. Scope queries as a cache-miss optimization, not a reflex.

### 5.4 The master decision table (situation → API → measured ratio → engine reason)

All ratios measured in this investigation's sandbox (Chrome 150) unless cited; engine citations point to the mechanism chapters.

| # | Situation | Use this | Measured margin | Engine reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Known id, document or shadow tree | `getElementById` (incl. `shadowRoot.getElementById`) | 1.18× over `qS('#id')`; O(1) flat 261→20K | TreeOrderedMap hash probe, interned key, no parse[^2^][^21^] |
| 2 | Id access in a hot loop | Cache the element reference in JS | Beats every re-query path | IC field load ~1–2 instructions vs irreducible binding crossing[^16^] |
| 3 | First/all elements of a class, ≥1K nodes | `getElementsByClassName` | 57× over `qSA('.cls')` @20K; O(1) | Class-indexed cached live list vs full scan + static list[^4^] |
| 4 | Elements of a tag, any size | `getElementsByTagName` | 38×/273×/3292× by size | Tag index; qSA must visit every node |
| 5 | Known first child / sibling walk | `firstElementChild` / `nextElementSibling` | 2.1× over `children[0]`; 2.3× over `nextSibling`-skip; ~2.2×/2.4× over TreeWalker/NodeIterator | Element filtering in C++; no collection/iterator allocation |
| 6 | Ancestor matching a selector | `closest()` | 4.1× over manual loop | Native ancestor walk; no per-level JS↔C++ crossing |
| 7 | Delegation guard per bubbled event | `tagName ===`, then `classList.contains` | 1.0 / 0.63 / 0.44 vs `matches()` | String identity < token-set lookup < selector match |
| 8 | Predicate over attributes | `qSA('[data-x="1"]')` | 19×/12× over `gEBTN('*')` + JS filter | Predicate evaluated in engine; no per-node `getAttribute` crossing |
| 9 | Complex relational criteria | `querySelector` with simple key compound | Ladder spread only 3.5× @20K | Right-to-left match; key compound filters candidates[^24^] |
| 10 | Need an id-scoped subtree | `getElementById('a').querySelectorAll('.b')` + `:scope` prefix | `#a .b` never faster than `.b` | Same candidate set; id prefix adds ancestor walk per survivor[^24^][^10^] |
| 11 | One-shot single hit | `querySelector`, not `qSA(...)[0]` | qSA('#id') 2.3× slower even when O(1) | Early-exit vs full walk + static-list allocation[^1^] |
| 12 | Repeated same query, read-only | Cache one live collection (or the element) | 6.1× over 100 fresh gEBCN; ~13,700× over 100 fresh qSA | Construction is the expense; liveness charges only on mutation |
| 13 | Read-only hot iteration | `for` loop, live collection, hoisted length | 1.23× / 1.37× / 2.4× over `.length`-per-iter / static list / `forEach` | Per-access re-validation is a C++ round trip; callback overhead |
| 14 | Iterate while mutating | Snapshot first (`Array.from`, static NodeList); `NodeIterator` for cursor walks | Correctness: live `length` moves under you[^30^] | Invalidation per mutation; pre-remove steps keep NodeIterator honest[^12^] |
| 15 | Mutation-dense regime | Static snapshot or cached array, not live collections | Live lists thrash on every relevant change | Ancestor invalidation walk per mutation[^5^] |
| 16 | Shrinking candidates by scope | Element-rooted qSA only when document caches miss | Document qS 1.28× faster (fixture-dependent) | Document class cache resolves rare classes without walking |
| 17 | Named element access | Never `window['id']` / `document.forms['name']` | 2.8× / 8.8× slower than gEBI | Named getter + collection construction, not the id map |
| 18 | Any exotic lookup (XPath) | Rewrite as class/tag/id; mirror `[attr]` with a class | XPath 26× over qSA; ~70,000× over gEBCN @20K | Interpreted engine, own snapshot object, zero index |
| 19 | Small DOM (<1K), cold path | Anything except XPath | Ratios hold; absolute times trivial | Constant factors dominate below scan-cost threshold |
| 20 | Selector string reused in a loop | Hoist the string; never generate selectors dynamically | Parse caches: 256/doc (Blink), 512 (WebKit)[^1^][^6^] | String-keyed parse caches thrash on novel strings |

Rows 1–10 resolve **what you know**; rows 11–16 resolve **how you access**; rows 17–20 are the standing prohibitions and regime rules. Where two rows collide — typically 12 versus 15, cache versus churn — the mutation rate is the tiebreaker: liveness is free exactly until the DOM moves. Architecture-level questions those collisions raise (cache invalidation policy, delegation topology, component-level query ownership) belong to Chapter 6; this chapter's job ends at the call site. Write the call that keeps you on a map, off the scan path, and out of the binding layer — in that order.
