# Verification Report — DOM Keyboard Event Listener & Key-Detection Performance Reference

Date: 2026-08-14 (verification). Method: every quantitative claim in sec03 recomputed from
`key-bench/results.json` (python3); sec05/sec06 measured references checked against the same
recomputation; sec02 checked claim-by-claim against `research/keyevent_dim02_engine_internals.md`;
sec04 checked against `research/keyevent_dim03_benchmark_evidence.md`. Flag threshold: >5% relative
error, plus factual/consistency errors regardless of magnitude.

## Per-chapter verdicts

| Chapter | Verdict | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| sec03 (measured results) | **FAIL** | All 64 table cells (median/ns/CV) and the trusted-layer table match raw data exactly, but 4 narrative numbers are wrong (>5%) and two n=15 poolings are mislabeled (trie wrongly flagged; remove case flag missing). |
| sec04 (published evidence) | **FAIL** | Every published number matches dim03 exactly, but three internal claims are unsupported by/contradictory to Ch 3 measurements ("tens-to-hundreds of ns"; "passive-on-keydown measured"; "N = 10…10,000"). |
| sec05 (decision matrix) | **FAIL** | Inherits sec03's two wrong numbers ("within 1.5%", "3× slower"); one 0.74 vs 0.75 µs inconsistency. All other anchors correct. |
| sec02 (engine internals) | **PASS (1 caveat)** | Every claim traced to dim02 verbatim/source-accurate. Caveat: "30 repeats/second" is not in dim02 (plausible OS-typical value, uncorroborated by the brief). |
| sec06 (library playbook) | **PASS (1 nit)** | All measured anchors match recomputation. Nit: "0.77 µs-per-pair" conflates per-add (0.767 µs) with per-pair (0.744 µs). |

## Checked claims — measured numbers (sec03 vs results.json)

### Table cells (all PASS)
All 63 case rows: medians, ns/op, CV, rel-to-fastest recomputed and match to stated rounding
(two integer-ns roundings: bitmask 60.46→60, trie 68.59→69 — normal rounding). Trusted layer:
252/234/635 presses/s, 200/200/200 & 200/0/0 event counts, 1.27/1.43/0.93 ms avg, 6.6/6.0/4.1 ms
max — all match `trusted` section exactly.

## sec02 vs dim02 (engine internals)

PASS on all targeted claims: SkipEventCapture default-on, `HasCaptureListener()` document-global
disable, WebKit `EventListenerCounts::hasCapturing` parallel; EventPath O(depth) exactly-sized
`HeapVector<Member<Node>,64>` + one GC allocation, no cache; copy-on-fire
`EventListenerVectorSnapshot = HeapVector<...,1>` with "Do not try to optimize it away" header;
Blink eager `key_`/`code_` in constructor (crbug.com/482880 TODO) vs Gecko
`GetDOMKeyName`/`GetDOMCodeName` per access (RFP spoofing note); one JS wrapper per event per
world (`main_world_wrapper_`/`DOMWrapperMap`); AbortSignal = K individual removal scans via
AbortSignalRegistry (whatwg/dom#911/PR #919); no compositor fast path for keys (frame attribution
only, quoted snippet matches); keys never coalesced/never frame-aligned; `once` =
remove-before-invoke; dedup on (callback, capture); crbug.com/1420890 log2 crash keys past 8;
`{handleEvent}` per-invocation Get; two dispatch passes per character keystroke; UIEventTiming
per dispatch, keyboard always eligible; `timeStamp == startTime`; WebKit bug 188370.
Caveat: "30 repeats/second" (§2.1.2) has no dim02 source — typical-OS value, uncorroborated.

Internal-consistency FAILs:
- §4.2.2 "Dispatch itself is tens-to-hundreds of nanoseconds per event in the engine" —
  contradicts Ch 3's own measurements (reused-event dispatch = **1,289 ns**; fresh keydown
  construct+dispatch = 4,072 ns; depth-500 = 32 µs). (Inherited from dim03 §2.4, but false
  against this work's data.)
- §4.1.3 "Our sandbox … capture vs bubble, delegation crossover at N = 10…10,000, property-read
  costs, and passive-on-keydown all measured" — results.json contains **no passive case**
  (suites 1–12, 14 only) and delegation was measured at N=1000/2000-node, not "N = 10…10,000".

## REQUIRED FIXES

1. **sec03 §3.1.1**: "depth 1→50 costs 1.6× (252.6k→142.3k ops/s for the root case)" →
   "depth 1→50 costs 1.8× (252.6k→142.3k ops/s for the root case; 1.6× for the leaf case)".
2. **sec03 §3.1.2**: "a 9.2 µs spread across bubble@leaf's own reps" → "a 10.6 µs spread…"
   (or "a 9.2k ops/s spread").
3. **sec03 §3.1.2 + sec05 §5.1.2 + sec05 §5.3 row 9**: "within 1.5%" → "within ~2.5% of each
   other" (extremes differ 2.2%) or "within 1.5% of their mean".
4. **sec03 §3.1.2 + sec05 §5.1.2 + sec05 §5.3 row 11**: "3× slower" → "2.7× slower"
   (221719/80959 = 2.74).
5. **sec03 Table 3-7 header + §3.3.2 text**: delete "trie pooled n=15" / "flagged, rerun, and
   pooled" — results.json records trie at n=10, agreement10=true.
6. **sec03 Table 3-13 header**: flag the remove case as pooled n=15 (results.json: n=15,
   agreement10=false), per the preamble's promise that outliers are "flagged where they appear".
7. **sec04 §4.2.2**: "tens-to-hundreds of nanoseconds per event" → "single-digit microseconds
   per event" (Ch 3: 1.3 µs reused-dispatch floor, 4 µs fresh keydown).
8. **sec04 §4.1.3**: drop "passive-on-keydown … measured" (no such case in results.json) and
   narrow "N = 10…10,000" to the measured N (1,000 listeners; 2,000-node tree).
9. **sec05 §5.2.1**: "one `addEventListener` costs ~0.74 µs" → "~0.75 µs" (0.74 µs is the
   add+remove pair, Table 3-13).
10. (minor) sec03 §3.2.1/sec05 §5.2.1 "within 4%" target checks → "within ~4.2%"; sec06 §6.1.2
    "0.77 µs-per-pair" → "0.77 µs per registration" (pair = 0.74 µs).

## Unverified scope

- rep-level distributions (bimodal ~26k/~32k bubble@leaf claim; trie deopt rep) — only
  min/max/median aggregates exist in results.json; claims are consistent with aggregates.
- sec06 library-source facts (VS Code/CM6/tinykeys/kbar/xterm internals, issue numbers) — outside
  dim02/dim03 ground truth; not checked.
- "30 repeats/second" (sec02) — uncorroborated by brief, plausible.
- No re-execution of the benchmark harness (verification from recorded raw data only).
