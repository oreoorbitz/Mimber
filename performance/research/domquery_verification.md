# Verification Report: DOM Query Performance Reference Document

**Verifier:** independent adversarial check
**Ground truth:** `/mnt/agents/output/dom-bench/results.json` (raw medians/CVs), `RESULTS.md` (derived), research briefs dim02/dim03
**Method:** every quantitative claim in sec03 recomputed from `results.json` medians (Python); sec05/sec06 measured references checked identically; sec02 claims cross-checked against dim02; sec04 published numbers against dim03; cross-chapter consistency scan; run1-vs-run2 stability claim recomputed from `results_run1.json`/`results_run2.json`; fixture claims checked against `bench.html`.
**Tolerance:** flag any numeric discrepancy >5% relative, or any rounding that changes meaning.

## Verdicts per chapter

| Chapter | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| sec02 (engine internals) | **PASS** | All spot-checked claims (256-entry FIFO cache, WebKit 512 random-eviction, CL 7900254, revert reason, TinyBloomFilter, NthIndexCache, r203439/bug 159960, ~70% Zbarsky, JIT ~2× 1100→<500 ms, quotes) match dim02 verbatim. Timeline table identical to dim02 §6. |
| sec03 (measured results) | **FAIL (1 numeric error + 1 rounding)** | ~120 numbers checked; all table values, CVs, rel columns, and ratios verified within tolerance EXCEPT the two items below. |
| sec04 (historical) | **FAIL (2 attribution errors)** | All 14 table rows and prose figures (1.08×, 1.7×/2.7×, 8.9×/4.7×, 1.9×, 1.4×, 1.8×, 6.4/4.3/2.1×, 29×, 51×, 4.5×, 3.9×, 2.3×, 32/13/20×, 1.04× parity, 5.4×, 1.5–2.3×, ~4× 15.3M→3.85M, '.test' bug) match dim03. Two framing errors below. |
| sec05 (decision matrix) | **FAIL (inherits sec03 rounding)** | All ratios match sec03/raw data; repeats the "~2.2× NodeIterator" figure (2.39× actual). |
| sec06 (playbook) | **PASS** | All measured references (13,700×, 6.1×, 38/273/3292×, 57×, 1.18×, 1.28×, 4.1×, 0.63/0.44, 23.97M, 12–19×, ≤3.5×, 1.23×, 2.1×/2.3×, 26×, ~70,000×, 3,292×) match raw data. External claims (LWC ~2.5×, Sizzle LRU=50, lit #2725) are cited, not measurable here. |

## sec04 attribution checks (vs dim03)

| Claim | Verdict |
|---|---|
| All ratio table rows (§4.1) and prose figures | PASS — match dim03 items #1–#29 exactly, ratios re-derived from cited ops/s pairs (29.16, 51.05, 4.45, 3.75, 2.27, 32.01, 5.36) |
| §4.3 "made Chrome 68–100 show 29–51× on classes" | **FAIL** — the 29× figure is ~2016 jsperf-era (pre-Chrome 68); Chrome 100 showed 4.5×. Era misattributed. |
| §4.1.2 heading "51× → 4.5× → 2–3×" | **FAIL** — no 2–3× class-gap figure exists in dim03 (modern figures are 4.5× [2022] and dim03's "~4–6× on Chrome 146+"); unsupported number. |

## Cross-chapter consistency

- 1.28× scoped-qS, 1.18× gEBI-vs-qS, 57×, 3,292×/3292×, 13,700×/13,715×, 6.1×, 19×/12×, 26×, ~70,000×, 4.1×/3.7×, 2.1×/3.7×, 0.63/0.44, 3.5×, 83×, 0.99–1.06×: **consistent everywhere**. ✓
- sec05 §5.1.1 "the 4–9× of the 2021–2026 published record" is cherry-picked (the 2021–2026 record also contains 1.4×/1.8×/1.9×/2.1×) but matches its two footnotes ([^11^]=8.9/4.7, [^2^]=6.4). Acceptable; noted.
- Wording: sec03 ¶1 and sec06 §6.2.1 say "2026 Blink **id-map** rewrite"; the rewrite (CL 7900254) was to **SelectorQuery**, not the id map (TreeOrderedMap unchanged). sec04 correctly says "SelectorQuery rewrite". Terminology fix recommended.

## REQUIRED FIXES

1. **sec03.md §3.4.1** — wrong string: `Both scan-based rows also degrade ~10× medium→large` → correct: `The XPath row degrades ~10× medium→large (the qSA row ~18×)`. (qSA: 74,688→4,247 ops/s = 17.6×.)
2. **sec03.md §3.3.2** (also sec05.md §5.1.2 and master-table row 5) — wrong string: `~2.2× over both TreeWalker (116.5K) and NodeIterator (105.7K)` → correct: `~2.2× over TreeWalker and ~2.4× over NodeIterator` (252,499/116,461 = 2.17; 252,499/105,697 = 2.39).
3. **sec04.md §4.3** — wrong string: `made Chrome 68–100 show 29–51× on classes` → correct: `made 2016–2018 Chrome show 29–51× on classes` (29× is ~2016 jsperf; Chrome 100 showed 4.5×).
4. **sec04.md §4.1.2 heading** — wrong string: `51× → 4.5× → 2–3×` → correct: `51× → 4.5×` (no published 2–3× class figure in the research corpus).
5. **(minor, recommended)** sec03.md ¶1 & sec06.md §6.2.1: `2026 Blink id-map rewrite` → `2026 Blink SelectorQuery rewrite`.

## Unverified scope

- Footnote targets/URLs (footnote definitions live outside the chapter files); external library claims in sec06 (LWC ~2.5×, Sizzle cacheLength=50, lit #2725) verified only as attributed citations, not against library sources.
- Absolute ops/s reproducibility (machine-specific by design); verification was ratio/table-internal against results.json.
