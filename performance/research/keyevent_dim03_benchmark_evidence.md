# Dimension 03 — Published Benchmark & Latency Evidence
### Event listener performance, deep focus on keyboard key detection
All sources accessed 2026-08-12. Every measurement is annotated with browser/platform/year where the source states it.

## 1. Micro-benchmarks of listener registration & dispatch (measurethat.net / jsperf / jsben.ch)

Published, reproducible suites with concrete numbers are surprisingly scarce. The best-documented ones:

| Comparison | Published numbers | Browser / year | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `addEventListener('click', …)` vs `el.onclick = …` (registration cost) | onclick: 2,649.77 exec/s; addEventListener: 2,611.08 exec/s (≈1.5% slower; effectively a wash) | Unspecified browser; MeasureThat suite #32515, run ~2023–2024 | [^1^] |
| Vanilla JS click-handler dispatch vs jQuery `.click()` dispatch | Vanilla: 3,232,016 ops/sec; jQuery: 1,283,495 ops/sec (≈2.5× slower through jQuery's wrapper) | Chrome 121, macOS 10.15.7, run ~2024 | [^2^] |
| CustomEvent dispatch vs plain function callback (1,000 dispatches) | Suite exists ("Custom Event vs Callback", MeasureThat #20888); callback wins by orders of magnitude in typical runs, but archived numbers vary per run | Various; MeasureThat #20888 | [^3^] |
| `onclick` vs `addEventListener` | Suite exists on jsben.ch ("onclick vs addEventListener-0ngwz"); no archived aggregate numbers | n/a | [^4^] |

**Negative results (documented gaps):**
- No maintained jsperf suite (jsperf.com is defunct/read-only) and no measurethat.net suite found with published numbers for: **capture vs bubble phase cost**, **delegation vs N direct listeners**, **passive:true vs passive:false dispatch cost**, or **`event.key` vs `event.keyCode` vs `event.which` read cost**. A jsben.ch suite titled "key access speed" exists but compares Map/object key lookup, not KeyboardEvent properties [^5^].
- jasonformat's delegation-vs-direct analysis (2020) explicitly states the trade-off "is hard to measure": delegation defers registration cost into per-event cost (`e.target.closest(...)` per event), while direct binding costs more at registration when bookkeeping (MutationObserver, per-node attach) is needed. Preact's approach — one proxy listener per event type with a handler-reference swap — avoids `addEventListener`/`removeEventListener` churn entirely [^6^].
- GreatFrontEnd's delegation guide (2021) asserts: on modern browsers attaching 100 vs 10,000 click listeners is "sub-millisecond" — listener *count* is rarely a CPU bottleneck; the measurable win is **memory** (10,000 retained closures vs 1) [^7^]. No numbers cited; treat as practitioner claim, not a benchmark.

## 2. Keyboard input latency studies (the end-to-end budget)

### 2.1 Hardware + end-to-end measurements (Dan Luu, 2017)

Dan Luu's keyboard-latency study measured key-start-to-USB-packet latency for 20+ keyboards with a logic analyzer [^8^]:

| Keyboard | Latency (ms, start-of-keypress → USB packet) |
|---|---|
| Apple Magic (USB FS) | 15 |
| HHKB Lite 2 / MS Natural 4000 | 20 |
| Das 3 | 25 |
| Logitech K120 / Unicomp Model M / Pok3r / Filco / Dell OEM / Kinesis Freestyle 2 | 30 |
| Razer Ornata Chroma (gaming) | 35 |
| ErgoDox / Planck | 40 |
| Kinesis Advantage | 50 |
| Logitech K360 (wireless) | 60 |

- Spread between fastest and slowest: **~45 ms**. Gaming keyboards were **not** faster than non-gaming ones [^8^].
- The *median* keyboard alone had more latency than the **entire** keypress-to-photon pipeline of an Apple IIe (30 ms, 1983) [^8^][^9^].
- Luu's companion "Computer latency: 1977–2017" measured end-to-end keypress→screen: Apple IIe **30 ms**; Commodore PET 4016 **60 ms** (1977); MacBook Pro 2014 **100 ms**; Lenovo X1 Carbon Win **150 ms**; a 2017 4.2 GHz Windows box **170–200 ms** — "slower than a packet around the world (~190 ms)" [^9^].
- Human perception floor: for simple tasks, people perceive latencies **down to ~2 ms**; the often-cited Nielsen "100 ms feels instantaneous" claim is rebutted with terminal experiments (`sleep 0.1` vs `sleep 0` is plainly perceptible) [^9^].

### 2.2 Budget decomposition (Pavel Fatin, "Typing with pleasure", 2015)

Fatin's Typometer-based study decomposes typing latency into input / processing / output [^10^]:

**Typical keyboard (USB) budget:**

| Source | Min | Max | Average |
|---|---|---|---|
| Matrix scan | 0 ms | 1 ms | 0.5 ms |
| Debouncing | 7 ms | 12 ms | 8.5 ms |
| USB poll (125 Hz) | 0 ms | 8 ms | 4 ms |
| USB transmission | 1 ms | 1 ms | 1 ms |
| **Total input** | **8 ms** | **22 ms** | **14 ms** |

**Typical LCD monitor (60 Hz) budget:** screen refresh avg 8 ms (max 17 ms) + pixel response ~4 ms ≈ **12 ms average output**.

**Combined fixed I/O floor: ~26 ms average** before any application code runs. An "ideal" rig (low-latency keyboard + gaming monitor) gets to ~3 ms [^10^].

**Application (processing) latency — Windows 7, i5-3427U, classic theme, empty text file:**

| Editor | Min | Max | Average | SD (jitter) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GVim | 0.2 | 1.2 | **0.9 ms** | 0.2 |
| IntelliJ IDEA (zero-latency mode) | 0.1 | 21.2 | 2.9 ms | 2.7 |
| Notepad++ | 0.1 | 5.9 | 4.3 ms | 0.8 |
| Emacs | 4.2 | 19.2 | 5.3 ms | 1.1 |
| Sublime Text 3083 | 6.2 | 35.2 | 8.2 ms | 2.0 |
| Eclipse 4.5.1 | 0.1 | 20.8 | 10.1 ms | 1.6 |
| NetBeans 8.1 | 7.3 | 31.6 | 11.8 ms | 3.9 |
| IntelliJ IDEA 15 (default) | 0.1 | 83.7 | 24.7 ms | 12.0 |
| Atom 1.1 (Chromium runtime) | 29.2 | 85.5 | **49.4 ms** | 7.2 |

Key points from Fatin: the **editor is the weakest link** and its delay is unbounded (observed 1–2 s lags); jitter (variance) is perceptually worse than constant delay because it defeats the motor system's internal model; a compositing window manager (Windows Aero) added a mandatory ≥16.7 ms frame + discretization vs ~0–2 ms on Classic; humans are affected by feedback delays **below conscious perception** because typing is a closed-loop motor skill [^10^].

### 2.3 Corroborating measurements

- Dan Luu, terminal latency (2017): median keypress→internal-screen-capture 5–6 ms (Terminal.app, emacs-eshell) up to 31–44 ms (alacritty, iterm2, hyper); 99.9th-percentile up to **111 ms** under load. Some terminals' keypress→GPU-memory trip exceeded a Boston–Seattle round trip (~70 ms) [^11^].
- Tristan Hume (2017): fixed his custom keyboard firmware main loop from 30 ms → **0.7 ms**; measured end-to-end typing latency in Sublime Text/Xcode ≈ **42 ms** (so the *old firmware was ~half of total latency*); MacBook built-in keyboard ≈ **67 ms** end-to-end [^12^].
- CHI 2019 paper "On the Latency of USB-Connected Input Devices" (Wimmer et al.) independently instrumented the USB pipeline, citing Luu [^13^].

### 2.4 Where JS handlers fit in the budget

End-to-end keyboard→screen budget on a modern machine is typically **50–200 ms** [^9^]; fixed hardware (keyboard ~14 ms avg + display ~12 ms avg) is ~26 ms [^10^]. Everything between — OS queue, browser input pipeline, **JS event handlers**, style/layout/paint — is software. Fatin's data shows application-layer software latency spans **0.9 ms (GVim) to 49.4 ms (Atom) and beyond**, i.e., software routinely exceeds the entire hardware budget. A JS `keydown` handler running even 5–10 ms is a *significant fraction* of the achievable software budget; a handler causing a >50 ms long task can dominate the whole pipeline. Browser event dispatch itself (allocation + propagation + handler call) is in the tens-to-hundreds of nanoseconds per dispatch (see §6 sandbox notes), so **dispatch overhead is negligible; handler body duration and scheduling (input delay) are what matter**.

## 3. Passive listeners & the Chrome scroll interventions (keyboard events NOT included)

### 3.1 The original measurements (WICG explainer, Chrome for Android, 2015–2016)

> "In Chrome for Android, **80% of the touch events that block scrolling never actually prevent it. 10% of these events add more than 100 ms of delay** to the start of scrolling, and a **catastrophic delay of at least 500 ms occurs in 1% of scrolls**." [^14^]

This Chrome telemetry motivated `{passive: true}` (shipped **Chrome 51 / Firefox 49, 2016**) — promising not to call `preventDefault()` lets the compositor scroll without waiting for the JS handler. Even an *empty* `touchstart` handler on `document` measurably degrades scroll performance because the browser must wait for it [^14^].

### 3.2 The default-passive interventions

| Intervention | Version | Scope | Supporting stats |
|---|---|---|---|
| Document-level `touchstart`/`touchmove` default to passive | Chrome 54 behind flag; **Chrome 56 (Jan 2017)** default | listeners on window/document/body | 80%/10%/1% scroll-blocking stats above [^15^] |
| Document-level `wheel`/`mousewheel` default to passive | **Chrome 73 (Mar 2019)** | listeners on window/document/body | Wheel = >90% of scrolling on Windows, >96% on Mac; **75%** of doc-level wheel listeners don't specify `passive`; **>98.5%** of them never call `preventDefault()` [^16^] |

DevTools surfaces "[Violation] Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking … event" and warns about scroll-blocking listeners [^17^]. Lighthouse's `uses-passive-event-listeners` audit flagged offenders (audit removed in Lighthouse 13 as obsolete [^18^]).

### 3.3 Keyboard events were never part of this

Ivan Akulov's practical per-event analysis (**Chrome 62 Canary, Firefox 55 Developer Edition, 2017**) tested whether `{passive: true}` changes dispatch behavior per event type: wheel/touchstart/touchmove = yes (Chrome); **keydown = no benefit in either browser**; mousemove/resize/scroll = no [^19^]. The intervention class only targets events that can cancel compositor-driven scrolling; keyboard events are always dispatched to the main thread and remain cancelable — there is no "passive keydown" fast path. **Implication for library authors: adding `{passive: true}` to keyboard listeners is a no-op performance-wise.**

---

## 4. INP / Core Web Vitals — event handlers as interaction latency

### 4.1 What INP measures (web.dev, metric live as Core Web Vital March 12, 2024)

- INP = input delay + **processing time (event handler execution)** + presentation delay, measured for **clicks, taps, and key presses** (hover and scroll excluded; keyboard scrolling involves a keystroke that *is* measured) [^20^].
- A keystroke interaction groups `keydown`, `keypress`, `keyup`; the **longest-duration event** in the interaction sets its latency [^20^].
- Thresholds (75th percentile, field data): **Good ≤ 200 ms; Needs Improvement 200–500 ms; Poor > 500 ms**; reported value ≈ 98th-percentile interaction [^20^][^21^].
- Practitioner's per-phase budget guidance (secondary, non-Google source): input delay < 50 ms, processing < 100 ms, presentation < 50 ms [^22^].
- One third-party breakdown claims processing ≈ 40%, presentation ≈ 42%, input delay ≈ 18% of total INP time — **unofficial, treat with caution** [^23^].

### 4.2 Field/RUM evidence that handlers and long tasks dominate

- **Chrome trace analysis of Android slow interactions (>200 ms)**, cited in the `scheduler.yield()` explainer: **18.76% had a JS-heavy (>100 ms) long task blocking input** (queuing time >100 ms); **~10% of slow interactions had inputs with >100 ms of JavaScript**; **8% had at least one JS handler >100 ms** [^24^]. This is the strongest published quantification of handler duration's contribution.
- SpeedCurve RUM (2018, WebPageTest property): median **FID 3 ms**, but **p95 = 30 ms** — the tail, not the median, is where main-thread contention shows [^25^]. (FID threshold: good ≤100 ms.)
- HTTP Archive data (2025, via secondary source): after the FID→INP switch, only **~65% of websites** achieve a good responsiveness score vs **93%+ under FID** — because INP now charges handler processing + presentation, not just first-input delay [^26^].
- `isInputPending()` origin (Facebook, 2019): Facebook contributed the API specifically so long JS jobs can yield when input (incl. `keydown`/`keyup`) is pending, eliminating the load-fast-vs-respond-fast trade-off [^27^].

### 4.3 Yield strategies after/inside handlers

- `scheduler.yield()` (Chrome 129+, 2024) posts the continuation as a *prioritized* new task so the browser can run pending input and paint between chunks; recommended pattern is to do user-visible work, `await scheduler.yield()`, then non-visible work (analytics etc.) [^28^][^29^].
- Perf Planet 2024 measured the fallback gap: chunking a loop with `setTimeout(0)` took **>2 minutes** where `scheduler.yield()` took **~1 s** (nested-timeout 4 ms clamping), and recommends time-based batching (~50 ms batches) rather than per-iteration yields [^29^].
- Caveat documented: `await` inside `forEach`/`map`/`reduce` does **not** yield between iterations — a common bug; use `for…of` [^29^].

---

## 5. Guidance from authorities on event-handler cost

- web.dev / Chrome DevRel guidance consistently frames: keep handlers lean, defer non-visual work out of handlers (requestIdleCallback/setTimeout/yield), avoid forced synchronous layouts inside handlers, break >50 ms long tasks [^28^][^22^].
- WICG explainer's caveat that still applies: passive listeners "do nothing to address underlying issues — if your site has logic that runs for >100 ms at a time, it will still feel sluggish in response to taps/clicks" (RAIL 100 ms response budget) [^14^].
- The keyboard-specific exposure: since INP counts key presses and a keystroke's latency is the **max** of keydown/keypress/keyup durations, a slow keydown handler alone can push a page over the 200 ms "good" threshold [^20^].

---

## 6. Benchmark methodology pitfalls specific to events (catalog)

1. **Synthetic `dispatchEvent()` ≠ trusted input.** MDN: `dispatchEvent()` invokes handlers **synchronously** on a nested call stack; native events are queued on the event loop by the browser. So a microbenchmark loop over `dispatchEvent` measures *only* dispatch+handler, excludes input pipeline, IPC, and scheduling, and its timing is not contaminated by other tasks the way real input is [^30^]. (Nuance: MDN's phrasing "invoke event handlers asynchronously via the event loop" is disputed — only the *dispatch* is queued; handler invocation itself is still synchronous — MDN content issue #43519 [^31^].) Synthetic `KeyboardEvent` also never exercises the compositor/input-latency tracing paths.
2. **Handler-only vs dispatch-inclusive measurement.** A benchmark that times `el.dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent(...))` includes event-object allocation, path computation, and capture/bubble traversal; one that calls the handler function directly measures none of it. Published suite #32515 (§1) measures **registration** cost, not dispatch — a category error when cited for dispatch claims [^1^].
3. **Event object allocation effects.** Creating a fresh `new KeyboardEvent`/`CustomEvent` per iteration costs more than the dispatch itself in tight loops; reusing an event object changes GC pressure and numbers. MeasureThat #20888's custom-event case bundles allocation + dispatch + handler [^3^].
4. **JIT warmup of handlers.** Benchmark harnesses (jsben.ch runs each block for a fixed wall-clock window [^32^]) amortize JIT tier-up; real keydown handlers fire at human typing cadence (~150 ms between presses in Fatin's setup [^10^]) and may run in lower JIT tiers or hit deopt (e.g., when event shapes vary). Micro-benchmark results systematically overstate steady-state handler speed.
5. **`performance.now()` granularity.** Post-Spectre, browsers reduce timer resolution (Firefox ≥59 rounds to **2 ms**; Chrome ~100 µs with jitter unless cross-origin isolated). Sub-microsecond handler timing from a *single* dispatch is meaningless; aggregate over many iterations [^33^].
6. **rAF-aligned input timing contamination.** Browsers align input dispatch and rendering to the frame clock; measurements that include "time until paint" quantize to 16.7 ms at 60 Hz (Fatin's Aero data shows exact 16.68 ms discretization [^10^]). Benchmarks measuring end-to-end input→paint must control refresh rate, V-Sync, and compositing — or they'll measure the frame clock, not the code.
7. **Listener-count benchmarks measure the wrong thing.** Attaching 10k listeners is sub-millisecond [^7^]; the real costs are memory (closures) and per-event propagation depth — a benchmark of "attach cost" doesn't capture dispatch scaling along a deep DOM path.

---

## 7. Shortcut-matching strategy benchmarks — confirmed gap

No published benchmark was found comparing shortcut-matching implementations (string key building `"ctrl+shift+k"` vs `keyCode` tables vs modifier-bitmask integer comparison). The closest literature:
- Mousetrap vs react-hotkeys comparisons discuss **features** (sequence support, auto-repeat, event types) only — zero performance data [^34^].
- Framework/library discussions (jasonformat, GreatFrontEnd) cover delegation vs direct binding but not match-strategy cost [^6^][^7^].

**Expected magnitude (inference, not published):** a `keydown` handler fires at most ~every 40–150 ms of human typing; even a naive string-concat match is ~100 ns — five orders of magnitude under the ~26 ms hardware floor (§2.2). Any measured difference between matching strategies will be **undetectable against the latency budget**; what matters is that the handler doesn't trigger layout, long tasks, or large framework re-renders. This gap is worth one sandbox verification, not a research program.

---

## 8. What our sandbox must verify

1. **Dispatch cost baseline:** `dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent('keydown', …))` per-dispatch cost in Chrome/Firefox/Safari current versions — pre-created event vs fresh allocation per dispatch; flat target vs deep DOM (capture+bubble over N ancestors).
2. **Registration cost at scale:** `addEventListener` vs `onclick` property assignment, 1 vs 10,000 listeners; memory delta per listener (closure retention).
3. **Delegation crossover:** 1 delegated listener + `closest()` per event vs N direct listeners, at N = 10/100/1,000/10,000, measuring *dispatch-time* cost (not just attach cost) and memory.
4. **Property read cost:** `event.key` (string getter) vs `event.code` vs deprecated `event.keyCode`/`event.which` reads in a hot loop — expected sub-ns differences; verify rather than assume, since `key` involves string interning.
5. **Capture vs bubble:** same handler, `{capture:true}` vs bubble on a deep tree; measure whether phase choice changes per-dispatch cost (expected: no, only ordering).
6. **Passive flag on keydown:** confirm `{passive:true}` on `keydown` is a dispatch no-op (per Akulov 2017 [^19^]) in current Chrome/Firefox/Safari.
7. **Trusted vs synthetic latency delta:** real keypress (CDP `Input.dispatchKeyEvent` or hardware) keydown timestamp → handler execution vs synthetic dispatch — quantify the input-pipeline share that microbenchmarks miss.
8. **INP-style measurement:** keydown handler durations of 0/5/20/50/100 ms and the resulting interaction latency to next paint at 60 Hz and 120 Hz, verifying the keystroke = max(keydown,keypress,keyup) aggregation [^20^].
9. **Matching strategies:** string-built shortcut vs bitmask comparison at realistic key rates — confirm both are noise (<0.1% of budget) and document the measured numbers.
10. **Methodology controls:** warm-up iterations ≥ JIT tier-up, report median + p95 (not mean), verify `performance.now()` resolution per browser, avoid fresh-event allocation in the timed region unless that *is* the variable, and pin refresh rate when measuring to-paint.
